## What is a neuropsychological assessment?

A neuropsychological assessment is usually requested by your doctor or neurologist to explore changes in your thinking, memory, or other cognitive abilities.

In this short video, you'll learn more about the purpose of a neuropsychological assessment and how it fits alongside other neurological tests like MRI and EEG.

## Why might I be referred?

If you (or someone close to you) has a condition that might be affecting how well you think, this kind of assessment can help understand what's going on and what will help. Common reasons for referral include:

- Attention problems and ADHD
- Head injury
- Aging or dementia concerns
- Multiple sclerosis
- Stroke effects
- Brain tumors

## What happens in an assessment?

<ol class="steps">
  <li><strong>Record review</strong> — We examine your medical history before we meet.</li>
  <li><strong>Interview (~1 hour)</strong> — We discuss your concerns and background.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing (~4 hours)</strong> — You complete tasks evaluating memory, attention, problem-solving, language, and processing speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Report and review</strong> — We analyse your performance compared to others of a similar background, review records, and may also interview your partner or a friend to understand your difficulties.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback (30–60 minutes)</strong> — We explain your results and recommendations, often via Zoom.</li>
</ol>

## Preparing for your assessment

Before your appointment, you will be asked to complete consent forms and gather relevant medical records. Bringing your records allows for a more accurate assessment.

- Neurologist or specialist records
- MRI, CT scan, or EEG results
