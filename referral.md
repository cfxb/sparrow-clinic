## Who refers patients?

Patients are referred by healthcare providers such as neurologists, family physicians, and other specialists. For example, you may have reported concerns about your memory or paying attention after a head injury.

Common referral questions include:

- Attention problems and ADHD
- Memory concerns and suspected dementia
- Cognitive impacts from neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, MS, brain injury)
- Baseline evaluations of thinking
- Return-to-work assessments

Please note we do not typically see patients whose primary concern is epilepsy.  Such patients should be referred to an epilepsy program, such as the one at Vancouver General Hospital.
